                Golduck is the fastest swimmer among all Pokémon. It swims effortlessly,
                even in a rough, stormy sea. It sometimes rescues people from wrecked
                ships floundering in high seas. The webbed flippers on its forelegs and
                hind legs and the streamlined body of Golduck give it frightening speed.
                This Pokémon is definitely much faster than even the most athletic
                swimmer.

                unkempt house and make it its home. At night, when the people in the house
                are asleep, it will go through the trash.
